# Papollo Hospital Data Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard built using **Power BI** to analyze and visualize key performance indicators from a hospital dataset. The goal is to provide meaningful insights that can support management-level decisions and operational improvements.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Hospital dataset containing 50,000+ patient records  
- **Data Features**: Patient IDs, admission dates, department types, treatments, costs, outcomes, and other operational metrics  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – for data modeling and dashboard design  
- **Power Query** – for data transformation and cleaning  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – for calculated measures  
- **Visualizations** – bar charts, slicers, trend lines, KPI cards

## What I Did
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Imported raw hospital data into Power BI
   - Handled missing values and performed data type corrections
   - Performed grouping and filtering for meaningful aggregation

2. **Data Modeling**
   - Created relationships between tables where needed
   - Defined calculated measures using DAX (like total revenue, average stay duration, etc.)

3. **Dashboard Development**
   - Built multiple interactive visuals to present trends and insights
   - Added slicers and filters for dynamic exploration
   - Designed visuals for key metrics like patient admissions, department performance, and revenue

## Key Insights
- **Trend Analysis**: Monthly patient counts and seasonal patterns
- **Department Performance**: Highest and lowest performing departments by metrics
- **Financial Insights**: Distribution of revenue and cost centers
- **Operational Metrics**: Treatment outcomes and resource utilization

## Outcome
This dashboard allows stakeholders to:
- Quickly identify performance trends
- Evaluate departmental bottlenecks
- Track operational KPIs easily
- Support data-driven healthcare decisions

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data transformation & cleaning
- DAX calculations
- Power BI dashboard design
- Business-oriented insight extraction

## How to Use
1. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**
2. Use slicers to filter by department, date, or other attributes
3. Explore visuals to understand patterns and insights
